SMTP Checker

This tool is designed to test SMTP server credentials from a sample file and report on their validity.

ðŸ“‹ Requirements:

Python Environment: Ensure you have Python set up on your machine.
Python Libraries: This tool uses the smtplib and os standard libraries.
SMTP Sample File (smtps.txt): The file should have the following structure:
vbnet
Copy code
URL: <URL>
METHOD: <METHOD>
MAILHOST: <SMTP_HOST>
MAILPORT: <SMTP_PORT>
MAILUSER: <SMTP_USER>
MAILPASS: <SMTP_PASS>
MAILFROM: <MAIL_FROM> (Optional)
FROMNAME: <FROM_NAME> (Optional)
Environment Variables: Store default email subject and recipient in an .env file:
DEFAULT_EMAIL_SUBJECT
DEFAULT_RECIPIENT
ðŸš€ Plan:

Load Environment Variables: Extract values from the .env file.
Extract SMTP Details: Read the smtps.txt sample file.
Test SMTP Credentials:
Use provided MAILFROM and FROMNAME or defaults if not provided.
Handle both port 465 (SSL) and port 587 (TLS).
Write Results:
Success: Working SMTP credentials are saved to working_smtps.txt.
Failure: Failed SMTP credentials, along with errors, are saved to failed_smtps.txt. Both files maintain the structure of the sample file.
ðŸ›  Usage:

Ensure the SMTP sample file (smtps.txt) is in the same directory as the script.
Execute the script: python main.py.
Review Results:
Valid Credentials: Check working_smtps.txt.
Invalid Credentials: Refer to failed_smtps.txt.
