# ðŸ“§ SMTP Checker

This tool is designed to test SMTP server credentials from a sample file and report on their validity.

## ðŸ›  Requirements:

1. Python environment.
2. `smtplib` and `os` Python standard libraries.
3. SMTP sample file (`smtps.txt`) with the following structure:
   - URL: <URL>
   - METHOD: <METHOD>
   - MAILHOST: <SMTP_HOST>
   - MAILPORT: <SMTP_PORT>
   - MAILUSER: <SMTP_USER>
   - MAILPASS: <SMTP_PASS>
   - MAILFROM: <MAIL_FROM> (Optional)
   - FROMNAME: <FROM_NAME> (Optional)

4. Default email subject and recipient stored in an `.env` file:
   - `DEFAULT_EMAIL_SUBJECT`
   - `DEFAULT_RECIPIENT`

## ðŸ“‹ Plan:

1. Load environment variables from the `.env` file.
2. Extract SMTP details from the `smtps.txt` sample file.
3. Test each SMTP credential:
    - Use the provided `MAILFROM` and `FROMNAME` or use defaults if not provided.
    - Handle both port 465 (SSL) and port 587 (TLS).
4. Write the results:
    - Working SMTP credentials are written to `working_smtps.txt`.
    - Failed SMTP credentials, along with the associated error, are written to `failed_smtps.txt`. Both files have the same structure as the sample file.

## ðŸš€ Usage:

1. Ensure the SMTP sample file (`smtps.txt`) is in the same directory as the script.
2. Run `main.py`.
3. Check `working_smtps.txt` for valid SMTP credentials and `failed_smtps.txt` for invalid ones.
